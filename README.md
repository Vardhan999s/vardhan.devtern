Housing-price-prediction-using-Regularised-linear-regression
1. Data Collection
First, you need a dataset containing various features of houses and their corresponding prices. A common dataset for this purpose is the Ames Housing dataset, which is publicly available.

2. Data Preprocessing
This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

3. Feature Selection
Choose the features that are most relevant to predicting house prices. This might involve domain knowledge or using statistical techniques to identify important features.
Features selected for this project are given in the dataset.

5. Model Training
Use linear regression to model the relationship between the features and the target variable (house price).

6. Model Evaluation
Assess the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
